2. Emails are processed if they meet the following criteria:
  - The email is from the specified sender (FROM).
  - The email is addressed to the specified recipient (TO).
  - The email's subject matches either SUBJECT_1 or SUBJECT_2.
3. Only links that meet the following criteria will be sent to the Telegram chat:
  - The link contains either HREF_1 or HREF_2.

bash ./run.sh
